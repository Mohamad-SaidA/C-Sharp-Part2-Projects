# CSHARP-and-.NET

This repository contains a collection of C# projects I built while learning the fundamentals of C# and the .NET ecosystem. Each project reflects concepts I practiced throughout the course, including object-oriented programming, interfaces, operator overloading, ASP.NET MVC, and working with SQL Server through Entity Framework.

## 🚀 What’s Inside
- Core C# exercises (classes, methods, OOP principles)
- Operator overloading and interface implementation
- ASP.NET MVC web application (Car Insurance Quote project)
- Database integration using Entity Framework
- Hands-on examples demonstrating real-world application structure

## 🎯 Skills Practiced
- Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces  
- Structuring reusable, maintainable code  
- MVC architecture and full‑stack workflows  
- CRUD operations and model validation  
- Working with SQL Server databases  

## 📚 Purpose
This repo serves as a personal archive of my progress as I learned C# and .NET. It highlights the foundational skills I’ll continue building on as I move into more advanced development.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
